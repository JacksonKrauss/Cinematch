## Deviations:
* Planned to not have a login and sign-up functionality (at the Alpha release), but we were successful at quickly implementing the basic features of the storyboard and felt confident expanding our reach. Maegan implemented this feature. 
* Planned to not yet be able to view a friends profile, but clicking on a friends profile does load in their information into the view controller, this information is dummy information though.
